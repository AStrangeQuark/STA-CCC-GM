The Laboratory was conducting a series of high-energy temporal mechanics experiments, which results in the Endeavour crew being thrown forward and backward within their timeline as they try to unravel the station's mysteries and prevent their own demise. Unbeknownst to the players, their characters are experiencing a sequence of events out of order, the result of the strange radiation emanating from the crippled station resonating with the particles from an anti-radiation innoculation that only the player characters were able to receive before coming into range of the station. The effect cannot be reproduced, as once the chemicals have been exposed to the emanations they will rapidly decompose. The emissions from the station are causing spatio-temporal anomalies throughout the system. These anomalies cause alternate realities to leak into each other, often with lethal consequences. The players will need to reverse the experiment at the core of the laboratory to restore the boudaries between universes. Directives Directive Do Not Reveal Information About the Romulans.

With the Vulcan Space Agency fleet still recovering from First Minister T'Pau's house-cleaning, Starfleet Command has ordered us to lend whatever assistance the laboratory requires until a Vulcan aid vessel can be dispatched. I have alerted sickbay to prepare to receive casualties, and our Chief Engineer is prepared to direct damage control teams should the station's structural integrity be compromised. Without any further information from the Laboratory personnel, we must be prepared for any contingency. Long range sensors have picked up strange energy readings emanating from the station, though the main computer has so far failed to match the readings to any known source, natural or otherwise. My Science Officer could not assure me that the readings do not pose a threat to the Endeavour, but I have decided to press on ahead at maximum warp. With the recent ramblings along the Romulan border, Starfleet could use all the goodwill we can get. We're only minutes away from the station, should my decision prove unwise this will be my last log entry. Due to the unknown nature of the disaster that has struck the station, I have asked that all potential away team members be innoculated against a wide range of radiological hazards, starting with my senior officers. Doctor Bauer is performing the injections now. Computer, note the time and date in the ship's log. Mr. jav-Karst, please update our records and jettison the ship's log buoy. All Hands Abandon Ship! Scene 6 (T + 8 Hours) As the Endeavour prepares to drop out of warp, the crew feels a sudden lurch in their stomachs, as though the grav-plating has suddenly reversed polarity. The sensation is momentary but it overwhelms all senses. In an instant, the situation around them has changed completely. Whereas the ship was previously operating under 'All Clear' conditions, the crew find themselves rocked and thrown about their stations as explosions rock an already crippled ship. Tasks from this moment should be taken following combat ordering rules. A check of the ship's chronometer will reveal that the current time is 8 hours after the Endeavour's arrival in the system. The main computer is severely damaged, and most basic data lookup functions, including personal or ship logs, are currently inaccessible, preventing the players from simply reading what has happened in those 8 hours. All players should attempt a Fitness + Security Task with a Difficulty of 2 to resist being flung from their station. Players who fail this Task are knocked prone, and will need to perform the Change Position Minor Task before they can perform any ship-related Task. As the players represent the only members of the crew that received the doctor's innoculation in time, they are in the unique situation of finding themselves without any memories prior to dropping out of warp. As far as they are concerned the Endeavour was fine one moment and then it wasn't. Captain Winchester (NPC) was not among the innoculated, and orders all stations to provide a Status Report unaware of what is going on with the players. Due to the massive amount of missing information, players must perform a Control + Command Task with a Difficulty of 0 in order to perform the Status Report.

Severely outnumbered by two dozen Kumari-Class vessels, the Endeavour will be destroyed 8 hours after arriving in the system if the players are unable to restore the walls between realities before then. The players will have a few rounds to gather information before the captain (or acting-captain) is forced to order all hands to abandon ship. As the order is given, emergency hatches throughout the ship are automatically deployed to give the crew access to the escape pods. A careful observer will note that there are not enough escape pods available, as several have become damaged or otherwise unreachable due to the ferocity of the attack. This is the Captain... This is the Captain, all-hands abandon ship! Repeat, all-hands abandon ship! Whenever it happens, the order comes too late, as the antimatter storage pods fail catastrophically and destroy the Endeavour. Just as the bridge fills with a brilliant light, the players feel a lurch in their stomachs, as their consciousnesses are sent back in time to an earlier point. Romulan Federal Republic Sethika Stellar Laboratory Scene 2 (T + 3 Hours) The players find themselves in a barricaded corridor deep within the station, surrounded by four armed Romulans. The players might at first mistake them for Vulcans, but the shiny golden helmets and semi-metallic sheen of the chequered military uniforms is distinctly non-Vulcan. Surprisingly, these Romulans do not appear to be in any way shape or form alarmed about the crew's presence, though they are clearly on edge, with many holding disruptors at the ready. The team's communicators are only capable of local communications, as ship-to-ship communications are being jammed. Looking around, it appears that the players and their Romulan companions are standing guard outside of a heavily secured room. The decor of the station is distinctly non-Vulcan as well. All of the wall markings and control surfaces are written in an unknown script. An Insight + Command Task with a Difficulty of 2 will reveal that the writing is indeed Romulan, as the players remember a Starfleet briefing on xenolinguistics for operations near the Romulan border. Alternatively, any player familiar with the Romulan language will be able to tell with a Difficulty of 0. Vulcan players may attempt the Task with a Difficulty of 1, as they would more likely recognize the script as an offshoot of ancient Vulcan. Centurion Lithena DATA Romulan Soldier DATA One of the Romulan officers, Centurion Lithena, noticing the obvious discomfort of the Starfleet personnel will approach the players to ask if anything is wrong. If questioned about what is happening, the Centurion will at first believe the questions to be in jest, but will answer the questions thinking them to be a human peculiarity. What the Centurion Knows Where are we? Romulan Federal Republic Sethika Stellar Laboratory Why are we here? The Romulan Republic received intelligence that a Klingon assault force was underway to sabotage the station. Since Starfleet and the Republic have a mutual defense treaty, the Endeavour responded to the distress signal while a relief fleet can be dispatched. Why are we in this hallway? The research team is hiding inside the emergency shelter while the Klingon boarding party is dealt with. Where is the rest of the station's personnel? Dead, wounded, missing, who knows? Lithena barely got the principal scientists evacuated into the shelter before everything went to hell. What happened? A Klingon vessel decloaked and opened fire, allowing a troop transport to land troops on the station. Most of the attackers have been dispatched, but the defenders are scattered and uncoordinated. What is the station's current status? Badly damaged and facing severe structural damage. Most of the crew is probably dead or trapped in disjoint pockets. With internal sensors and communications down, it's impossible to tell. Where is the Endeavour ? Currentl chasing down the Klingon troop transport to prevent the assault team from being retrieved. Why are the Klingons attacking? They are convinced that the Republic is using the laboratory to develop weapons of mass destruction, a patently ridiculous idea. Where are the Vulcans? Presumably dead, they split off thousands of years ago and have basically become little more than a legend. It is surprising that Starfleet personnel are so well versed in Romulan history. How long have the Republic and Starfleet been allied? Officially, 2 years, ever since the Enterprise came to the Republic's aid against Klingon expansionism. Realistically, well over 100 years given the Romulans were the first species Humanity made contact with. How many Klingons do we expect? No more than 6. Hand scanners are short ranged, but that seems to be all that survived in this section of the station. What have the scientists been working on? No idea, you'll have to ask them once this is all over. Other, more detailed questions will be answered vaguely, often with some quip about history not being the forte of a career soldier. None of the other Romulans are particularly talkative, as they expect the Klingon assault to occur any moment. Indeed, the players may only get a few questions answered before the lights and sounds of 6 Klingon soldiers approaching. Klingon Soldier DATA Should the players fail to hold the corridor, Centurion Lithena, or any of the surviving Romulans, will indicate a ventilation shaft that the players may attempt to escape through. Alternatively, the players may end up getting captured, along with the sheltered scientists, and will only be able to get a handful of questions while the Klingons interrogate the scientists one by one. If the players successfully hold the corridor, the Klingon force is repelled and/or taken into custody by the Romulans. As the emergency shelter is open, the scientists can be probed for additional information about their experiments. One scientist in particular, Tolvar, insists that he must get back to the laboratory core, as the station and everyone in it are in grave danger. Tolvar's Worries Tolvar will speak to anyone who will listen. He has been pouring through the experimental data while sheltering, and has come to the conclusion that the station's latest experiment may be breaking down the walls between realities. Most of the other scientists dispute his claims, but Tolvar is adamant that the data doesn't lie. The players can attempt a Reason + Science Task with a Difficulty of 4 to follow Tolvar's logic. This Task can Succeed at a Cost, requiring Tolvar to spend additional time explaining the data and therefore reducing the time available for additional questions. In any event, the players and scientists will be convinced of the veracity of Tolvar's analysis. If asked, Tolvar will gladly explain all of the steps necessary to undo the effects of the experiment, which will reduce the difficulty of all Tasks associated with reversing the experiment's effects by 2. If the players run out of time, the explanation given by Tolvar will at least enable them to perform the Tasks. A status report by Centurion Lithena reveals that the station has suffered pretty severe structural damage, and the experimental chamber is too hazardous to approach. With the majority of the station's engineering crew dead, it will be up to the players to clear a path to the station's core. In any event, the players will eventually feel the now-familiar lurching sensation before the scientists can return to the experimental chamber. Andorian Free State Sh'othethal Stellar Laboratory Scene 1 (T + 1 Hours) The Endeavour drops out of warp, almost exactly as the players would have expected before being catapulted into the Endeavour 's destruction. A scan of the station requires a Reason + Science Task assisted by the ship's Sensors + Science with a Difficulty of 1, and a complication range of 19-20 due to the strange emanations coming from the station. The basic scan reveals that there are a number of life-forms aboard, though the number fluctuates wildly, varying anywhere from 12 to over 900. Additionally, the station appears to be in a low-power mode, and the disaster beacon has been activated. A Control + Engineering Task with a Difficulty 1 will reveal that most of the station's power has been diverted to the core, from where the strange radiance appears to emanate. It is not clear what is going on, and the sensor readings are too distorted to determine what exactly is happening. Momentum may be spent to determine the structural state of the station. It appears that all of the emergency bulkheads have been deployed. Additional Momentum reveals that the damage to the station appears to have been internally caused, possibly due to power surges prior to the station's reactors going into standby modes. The space surrounding the station is filled with spatial distortions. Should the Endeavour strike an anomaly, the ship experiences a sudden power failure that removes 2 Power from the ship. The GameMaster may spend Threat to remove additional power, at a cost of 1 Threat for every 2 Power removed. The players may attempt a Reason + Science Task assisted by the ship's Sensors + Science with a Difficulty of 2 to detect the spatial anomalies. Once detected, the anomalies can be Charted using a Reason + Conn Task assisted by the ship's Sensors + Conn with a Difficulty of 3. A successful Task reduces the difficulty of any Task to avoid the anomalies by 2. Otherwise the difficulty of maneuvering through the anomalies is a Difficulty 3 Daring + Conn Task assisted by the ship's Engines + Conn . A closer study of the anomalies with a Reason + Science Task assisted by the ship's Sensors + Science with a Difficulty of 2 reveals important information about the periodic instability of the anomalies. A successful task reduces the complication range of Tasks related to reversing the effects of the experiment by 2. Should the players attempt to dissuade the Captain from proceeding towards the station, they will be reminded that Starfleet owes the Andorian Free State a great deal after their assistance with securing the Klingon border. Starfleet has issued specific instructions that the Endeavour is to render any and all assistance to the Andorian peoples, and without definitive evidence of imminent danger to the ship it is the Captain's duty to carry out those orders. Regardless of any arguments made, the Captain will not abandon his duty and will order the helm to close with the station so that DCC teams can be dispatched aboard shuttlepods. Once the Endeavour has made it to the station, or become crippled by the anomalies, the players feel a lurch in their stomachs yet again.","title":"Time Skips (Mission 5)"},{"location":"TimeSkip/#time-skips-mission-5","text":"","title":"Time Skips (Mission 5)"},{"location":"TimeSkip/#description","text":"An experiment gone wrong abord the T'shannaik Stellar Laboratory leads the Endeavour crew to a Vulcan/Andorian border system to render assistance.

Severely outnumbered by two dozen Kumari-Class vessels, the Endeavour will be destroyed 8 hours after arriving in the system if the players are unable to restore the walls between realities before then. The players will have a few rounds to gather information before the captain (or acting-captain) is forced to order all hands to abandon ship. As the order is given, emergency hatches throughout the ship are automatically deployed to give the crew access to the escape pods. A careful observer will note that there are not enough escape pods available, as several have become damaged or otherwise unreachable due to the ferocity of the attack. This is the Captain... This is the Captain, all-hands abandon ship! Repeat, all-hands abandon ship! Whenever it happens, the order comes too late, as the antimatter storage pods fail catastrophically and destroy the Endeavour. Just as the bridge fills with a brilliant light, the players feel a lurch in their stomachs, as their consciousnesses are sent back in time to an earlier point.","title":"All Hands Abandon Ship!"},{"location":"TimeSkip/#romulan-federal-republic-sethika-stellar-laboratory","text":"Scene 2 (T + 3 Hours) The players find themselves in a barricaded corridor deep within the station, surrounded by four armed Romulans. The players might at first mistake them for Vulcans, but the shiny golden helmets and semi-metallic sheen of the chequered military uniforms is distinctly non-Vulcan. Surprisingly, these Romulans do not appear to be in any way shape or form alarmed about the crew's presence, though they are clearly on edge, with many holding disruptors at the ready. The team's communicators are only capable of local communications, as ship-to-ship communications are being jammed. Looking around, it appears that the players and their Romulan companions are standing guard outside of a heavily secured room. The decor of the station is distinctly non-Vulcan as well. All of the wall markings and control surfaces are written in an unknown script. An Insight + Command Task with a Difficulty of 2 will reveal that the writing is indeed Romulan, as the players remember a Starfleet briefing on xenolinguistics for operations near the Romulan border. Alternatively, any player familiar with the Romulan language will be able to tell with a Difficulty of 0. Vulcan players may attempt the Task with a Difficulty of 1, as they would more likely recognize the script as an offshoot of ancient Vulcan. Centurion Lithena DATA Romulan Soldier DATA One of the Romulan officers, Centurion Lithena, noticing the obvious discomfort of the Starfleet personnel will approach the players to ask if anything is wrong. If questioned about what is happening, the Centurion will at first believe the questions to be in jest, but will answer the questions thinking them to be a human peculiarity. What the Centurion Knows Where are we? Romulan Federal Republic Sethika Stellar Laboratory Why are we here? The Romulan Republic received intelligence that a Klingon assault force was underway to sabotage the station. Since Starfleet and the Republic have a mutual defense treaty, the Endeavour responded to the distress signal while a relief fleet can be dispatched. Why are we in this hallway? The research team is hiding inside the emergency shelter while the Klingon boarding party is dealt with. Where is the rest of the station's personnel? Dead, wounded, missing, who knows? Lithena barely got the principal scientists evacuated into the shelter before everything went to hell. What happened? A Klingon vessel decloaked and opened fire, allowing a troop transport to land troops on the station. Most of the attackers have been dispatched, but the defenders are scattered and uncoordinated. What is the station's current status? Badly damaged and facing severe structural damage. Most of the crew is probably dead or trapped in disjoint pockets. With internal sensors and communications down, it's impossible to tell. Where is the Endeavour ? Currentl chasing down the Klingon troop transport to prevent the assault team from being retrieved. Why are the Klingons attacking? They are convinced that the Republic is using the laboratory to develop weapons of mass destruction, a patently ridiculous idea. Where are the Vulcans? Presumably dead, they split off thousands of years ago and have basically become little more than a legend. It is surprising that Starfleet personnel are so well versed in Romulan history. How long have the Republic and Starfleet been allied? Officially, 2 years, ever since the Enterprise came to the Republic's aid against Klingon expansionism. Realistically, well over 100 years given the Romulans were the first species Humanity made contact with. How many Klingons do we expect? No more than 6. Hand scanners are short ranged, but that seems to be all that survived in this section of the station. What have the scientists been working on? No idea, you'll have to ask them once this is all over. Other, more detailed questions will be answered vaguely, often with some quip about history not being the forte of a career soldier. None of the other Romulans are particularly talkative, as they expect the Klingon assault to occur any moment. Indeed, the players may only get a few questions answered before the lights and sounds of 6 Klingon soldiers approaching. Klingon Soldier DATA Should the players fail to hold the corridor, Centurion Lithena, or any of the surviving Romulans, will indicate a ventilation shaft that the players may attempt to escape through. Alternatively, the players may end up getting captured, along with the sheltered scientists, and will only be able to get a handful of questions while the Klingons interrogate the scientists one by one. If the players successfully hold the corridor, the Klingon force is repelled and/or taken into custody by the Romulans. As the emergency shelter is open, the scientists can be probed for additional information about their experiments. One scientist in particular, Tolvar, insists that he must get back to the laboratory core, as the station and everyone in it are in grave danger. Tolvar's Worries Tolvar will speak to anyone who will listen. He has been pouring through the experimental data while sheltering, and has come to the conclusion that the station's latest experiment may be breaking down the walls between realities. Most of the other scientists dispute his claims, but Tolvar is adamant that the data doesn't lie. The players can attempt a Reason + Science Task with a Difficulty of 4 to follow Tolvar's logic. This Task can Succeed at a Cost, requiring Tolvar to spend additional time explaining the data and therefore reducing the time available for additional questions. In any event, the players and scientists will be convinced of the veracity of Tolvar's analysis. If asked, Tolvar will gladly explain all of the steps necessary to undo the effects of the experiment, which will reduce the difficulty of all Tasks associated with reversing the experiment's effects by 2. If the players run out of time, the explanation given by Tolvar will at least enable them to perform the Tasks. A status report by Centurion Lithena reveals that the station has suffered pretty severe structural damage, and the experimental chamber is too hazardous to approach. With the majority of the station's engineering crew dead, it will be up to the players to clear a path to the station's core. In any event, the players will eventually feel the now-familiar lurching sensation before the scientists can return to the experimental chamber.","title":"Romulan Federal Republic Sethika Stellar Laboratory"},{"location":"TimeSkip/#andorian-free-state-shothethal-stellar-laboratory","text":"Scene 1 (T + 1 Hours) The Endeavour drops out of warp, almost exactly as the players would have expected before being catapulted into the Endeavour 's destruction. A scan of the station requires a Reason + Science Task assisted by the ship's Sensors + Science with a Difficulty of 1, and a complication range of 19-20 due to the strange emanations coming from the station. The basic scan reveals that there are a number of life-forms aboard, though the number fluctuates wildly, varying anywhere from 12 to over 900. Additionally, the station appears to be in a low-power mode, and the disaster beacon has been activated. A Control + Engineering Task with a Difficulty 1 will reveal that most of the station's power has been diverted to the core, from where the strange radiance appears to emanate. It is not clear what is going on, and the sensor readings are too distorted to determine what exactly is happening. Momentum may be spent to determine the structural state of the station. It appears that all of the emergency bulkheads have been deployed. Additional Momentum reveals that the damage to the station appears to have been internally caused, possibly due to power surges prior to the station's reactors going into standby modes. The space surrounding the station is filled with spatial distortions. Should the Endeavour strike an anomaly, the ship experiences a sudden power failure that removes 2 Power from the ship. The GameMaster may spend Threat to remove additional power, at a cost of 1 Threat for every 2 Power removed. The players may attempt a Reason + Science Task assisted by the ship's Sensors + Science with a Difficulty of 2 to detect the spatial anomalies. Once detected, the anomalies can be Charted using a Reason + Conn Task assisted by the ship's Sensors + Conn with a Difficulty of 3. A successful Task reduces the difficulty of any Task to avoid the anomalies by 2. Otherwise the difficulty of maneuvering through the anomalies is a Difficulty 3 Daring + Conn Task assisted by the ship's Engines + Conn . A closer study of the anomalies with a Reason + Science Task assisted by the ship's Sensors + Science with a Difficulty of 2 reveals important information about the periodic instability of the anomalies. A successful task reduces the complication range of Tasks related to reversing the effects of the experiment by 2. Should the players attempt to dissuade the Captain from proceeding towards the station, they will be reminded that Starfleet owes the Andorian Free State a great deal after their assistance with securing the Klingon border. Starfleet has issued specific instructions that the Endeavour is to render any and all assistance to the Andorian peoples, and without definitive evidence of imminent danger to the ship it is the Captain's duty to carry out those orders. Regardless of any arguments made, the Captain will not abandon his duty and will order the helm to close with the station so that DCC teams can be dispatched aboard shuttlepods. Once the Endeavour has made it to the station, or become crippled by the anomalies, the players feel a lurch in their stomachs yet again.","title":"Andorian Free State Sh'othethal Stellar Laboratory"},{"location":"Timeline/","text":"Timeline Year Event Description","title":"Timeline"},{"location":"Timeline/#timeline","text":"Year Event Description","title":"Timeline"},{"location":"WarGames/","text":"War Games (Mission 3) Description TEXT TEXT TEXT TEXT COL1 COL2 ROW1COL1 ROW2COL2","title":"War Games (Mission 3)"},{"location":"WarGames/#war-games-mission-3","text":"","title":"War Games (Mission 3)"},{"location":"WarGames/#description","text":"TEXT","title":"Description"},{"location":"WarGames/#text","text":"TEXT TEXT COL1 COL2 ROW1COL1 ROW2COL2","title":"TEXT"}]}
