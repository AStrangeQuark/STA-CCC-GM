  Description: >-
    An experiment gone wrong abord the T'shannaik Stellar Laboratory leads the
    Endeavour crew to a Vulcan/Andorian border system to render assistance. The
    Laboratory was conducting a series of high-energy temporal mechanics experiments,
    which results in the Endeavour crew being thrown forward and backward within
    their timeline as they try to unravel the station's mysteries and prevent their
    own demise.


    Unbeknownst to the players, their characters are experiencing a sequence of
    events out of order, the result of the strange radiation emanating from the
    crippled station resonating with the particles from an anti-radiation
    innoculation that only the player characters were able to receive *before*
    coming into range of the station. The effect cannot be reproduced, as once
    the chemicals have been exposed to the emanations they will rapidly decompose.


    The emissions from the station are causing spatio-temporal anomalies throughout
    the system. These anomalies cause alternate realities to *leak* into each other,
    often with lethal consequences. The players will need to reverse the experiment
    at the core of the laboratory to restore the boudaries between universes.

    Title: Vucan Science Directorate T'shannaik Stellar Laboratory
    Text: >-
      !!! quote "Captain's Log: Stardate 2161.7"

          The Endeavour is responding to an automated distress signal from the Vulcan
          T'shannaik Stellar Laboratory on the Vulcan-Andorian border. With the
          Vulcan Space Agency fleet still recovering from First Minister T'Pau's
          house-cleaning, Starfleet Command has ordered us to lend whatever
          assistance the laboratory requires until a Vulcan aid vessel can be
          dispatched. I have alerted sickbay to prepare to receive casualties, and
          our Chief Engineer is prepared to direct damage control teams should the
          station's structural integrity be compromised. Without any further information
          from the Laboratory personnel, we must be prepared for any contingency.


          Long range sensors have picked up strange energy readings emanating from
          the station, though the main computer has so far failed to match the
          readings to any known source, natural or otherwise. My Science Officer
          could not assure me that the readings do not pose a threat to the
          Endeavour, but I have decided to press on ahead at maximum warp. With the
          recent ramblings along the Romulan border, Starfleet could use all the
          goodwill we can get. We're only minutes away from the station, should my
          decision prove unwise this will be my last log entry. Due to the unknown
          nature of the disaster that has struck the station, I have asked that all
          potential away team members be innoculated against a wide range of
          radiological hazards, starting with my senior officers. Doctor Bauer is
          performing the injections now.


          Computer, note the time and date in the ship's log. Mr. jav-Karst, please
          update our records and jettison the ship's log buoy.

    Title: All Hands Abandon Ship!
    Subtitle: Scene 6 (T + 8 Hours)
    Text: >-
      As the Endeavour prepares to drop out of warp, the crew feels a sudden lurch
      in their stomachs, as though the grav-plating has suddenly reversed polarity.
      The sensation is momentary but it overwhelms all senses. In an instant, the
      situation around them has changed completely. Whereas the ship was previously
      operating under 'All Clear' conditions, the crew find themselves rocked and
      thrown about their stations as explosions rock an already crippled ship. Tasks
      from this moment should be taken following combat ordering rules.


      A check of the ship's chronometer will reveal that the current time is 8 hours
      after the Endeavour's arrival in the system. The main computer is severely
      damaged, and most basic data lookup functions, including personal or ship
      logs, are currently inaccessible, preventing the players from simply reading
      what has happened in those 8 hours.


      All players should attempt a **Fitness + Security Task** with a Difficulty of
      2 to resist being flung from their station. Players who fail this Task are
      knocked prone, and will need to perform the *Change Position* Minor Task
      before they can perform any ship-related Task.


      As the players represent the only members of the crew that received the
      doctor's innoculation in time, they are in the unique situation of finding
      themselves without any memories prior to dropping out of warp. As far as they
      are concerned the Endeavour was fine one moment and then it wasn't. Captain
      Winchester (NPC) was not among the innoculated, and orders all stations to
      provide a Status Report unaware of what is going on with the players.


      Due to the massive amount of missing information, players must perform a
      Control + Command Task with a Difficulty of 0 in order to perform the Status
      Report.

      Unbeknownst to the players, the Endeavour is currently under attack from
      an Andorian fleet from an alternate reality where the United Coalition of
      Planets never formed as the Enterprise failed to prevent a war between Vulcan
      and Andoria. Severely outnumbered by two dozen *Kumari-Class* vessels, the
      Endeavour will be destroyed 8 hours after arriving in the system if the players
      are unable to restore the walls between realities before then.


      The players will have a few rounds to gather information before the captain (or
      acting-captain) is forced to order all hands to abandon ship. As the order is
      given, emergency hatches throughout the ship are automatically deployed to give
      the crew access to the escape pods. A careful observer will note that there are
      not enough escape pods available, as several have become damaged or otherwise
      unreachable due to the ferocity of the attack.


      !!! quote "This is the Captain..."

          *This is the Captain, all-hands abandon ship! Repeat, all-hands
          abandon ship!*
      

      Whenever it happens, the order comes too late, as the antimatter storage pods
      fail catastrophically and destroy the Endeavour. Just as the bridge fills with
      a brilliant light, the players feel a lurch in their stomachs, as their
      consciousnesses are sent back in time to an earlier point.

    Subtitle: Scene 2 (T + 3 Hours)
    Text: >-
      The players find themselves in a barricaded corridor deep within the station,
      surrounded by four armed Romulans. The players might at first mistake them for
      Vulcans, but the shiny golden helmets and semi-metallic sheen of the chequered
      military uniforms is distinctly non-Vulcan. Surprisingly, these Romulans do not
      appear to be in any way shape or form alarmed about the crew's presence, though
      they are clearly on edge, with many holding disruptors at the ready. The team's
      communicators are only capable of local communications, as ship-to-ship
      communications are being jammed.
      

      Looking around, it appears that the players and their Romulan companions are
      standing guard outside of a heavily secured room. The decor of the station is
      distinctly non-Vulcan as well. All of the wall markings and control surfaces
      are written in an unknown script. An **Insight + Command** Task with a
      Difficulty of 2 will reveal that the writing is indeed Romulan, as the players
      remember a Starfleet briefing on xenolinguistics for operations near the
      Romulan border. Alternatively, any player familiar with the Romulan language
      will be able to tell with a Difficulty of 0. Vulcan players may attempt the
      Task with a Difficulty of 1, as they would more likely recognize the script as
      an offshoot of ancient Vulcan.

      One of the Romulan officers, Centurion Lithena, noticing the obvious discomfort
      of the Starfleet personnel will approach the players to ask if anything is
      wrong. If questioned about what is happening, the Centurion will at first
      believe the questions to be in jest, but will answer the questions thinking
      them to be a human peculiarity.


      ??? info "What the Centurion Knows"

          - Where are we?  
              - Romulan Federal Republic Sethika Stellar Laboratory  
          - Why are we here?  
              - The Romulan Republic received intelligence that a Klingon assault force
              was underway to sabotage the station. Since Starfleet and the Republic
              have a mutual defense treaty, the Endeavour responded to the distress
              signal while a relief fleet can be dispatched.
          - Why are we in this hallway?
              - The research team is hiding inside the emergency shelter while the
              Klingon boarding party is dealt with.  
          - Where is the rest of the station's personnel?  
              - Dead, wounded, missing, who knows? Lithena barely got the principal
              scientists evacuated into the shelter before everything went to hell.  
          - What happened?  
              - A Klingon vessel decloaked and opened fire, allowing a troop transport
              to land troops on the station. Most of the attackers have been dispatched,
              but the defenders are scattered and uncoordinated.
          - What is the station's current status?
              - Badly damaged and facing severe structural damage. Most of the
              crew is probably dead or trapped in disjoint pockets. With internal
              sensors and communications down, it's impossible to tell.
          - Where is the *Endeavour*?  
              - Currentl chasing down the Klingon troop transport to prevent the
              assault team from being retrieved.
          - Why are the Klingons attacking?
              - They are convinced that the Republic is using the laboratory to
              develop weapons of mass destruction, a patently ridiculous idea.
          - Where are the Vulcans?
              - Presumably dead, they split off thousands of years ago and have
              basically become little more than a legend. It is surprising that
              Starfleet personnel are so well versed in Romulan history.
          - How long have the Republic and Starfleet been allied?  
              - Officially, 2 years, ever since the *Enterprise* came to the Republic's
              aid against Klingon expansionism. Realistically, well over 100 years given
              the Romulans were the first species Humanity made contact with.
          - How many Klingons do we expect?
              - No more than 6. Hand scanners are short ranged, but that seems to be
              all that survived in this section of the station.
          - What have the scientists been working on?
              - No idea, you'll have to ask them once this is all over.

              
          Other, more detailed questions will be answered vaguely, often with some
          quip about history not being the forte of a career soldier.


      None of the other Romulans are particularly talkative, as they expect the
      Klingon assault to occur any moment. Indeed, the players may only get a few
      questions answered before the lights and sounds of 6 Klingon soldiers
      approaching.


      ??? danger "Klingon Soldier"

          DATA


      Should the players fail to hold the corridor, Centurion Lithena, or any of the
      surviving Romulans, will indicate a ventilation shaft that the players may
      attempt to escape through. Alternatively, the players may end up getting
      captured, along with the sheltered scientists, and will only be able to get a
      handful of questions while the Klingons interrogate the scientists one by one.


      If the players successfully hold the corridor, the Klingon force is repelled
      and/or taken into custody by the Romulans. As the emergency shelter is open,
      the scientists can be probed for additional information about their
      experiments. One scientist in particular, Tolvar, insists that he must get back
      to the laboratory core, as the station and everyone in it are in grave danger.


      ??? info "Tolvar's Worries"

          Tolvar will speak to anyone who will listen. He has been pouring through the
          experimental data while sheltering, and has come to the conclusion that the
          station's latest experiment may be breaking down the walls between realities.


          Most of the other scientists dispute his claims, but Tolvar is adamant that
          the data doesn't lie. The players can attempt a **Reason + Science** Task
          with a Difficulty of 4 to follow Tolvar's logic. This Task can Succeed at
          a Cost, requiring Tolvar to spend additional time explaining the data and
          therefore reducing the time available for additional questions. In any
          event, the players and scientists will be convinced of the veracity of
          Tolvar's analysis.


          If asked, Tolvar will gladly explain all of the steps necessary to undo
          the effects of the experiment, which will reduce the difficulty of all
          Tasks associated with reversing the experiment's effects by 2. If the
          players run out of time, the explanation given by Tolvar will at least
          enable them to perform the Tasks.


      A status report by Centurion Lithena reveals that the station has suffered
      pretty severe structural damage, and the experimental chamber is too hazardous
      to approach. With the majority of the station's engineering crew dead, it will
      be up to the players to clear a path to the station's core.


      In any event, the players will eventually feel the now-familiar lurching
      sensation before the scientists can return to the experimental chamber.

    Text: >-
      The *Endeavour* drops out of warp, almost exactly as the players would have
      expected before being catapulted into the *Endeavour*'s destruction.


      A scan of the station requires a **Reason + Science** Task assisted by the
      ship's **Sensors + Science** with a Difficulty of 1, and a complication range
      of 19-20 due to the strange emanations coming from the station. The basic scan
      reveals that there are a number of life-forms aboard, though the number
      fluctuates wildly, varying anywhere from 12 to over 900. Additionally, the
      station appears to be in a low-power mode, and the disaster beacon has been
      activated.


      A **Control + Engineering** Task with a Difficulty 1 will reveal that most of
      the station's power has been diverted to the core, from where the strange
      radiance appears to emanate. It is not clear what is going on, and the sensor
      readings are too distorted to determine what exactly is happening. Momentum may
      be spent to determine the structural state of the station. It appears that all
      of the emergency bulkheads have been deployed. Additional Momentum reveals that
      the damage to the station appears to have been internally caused, possibly due
      to power surges prior to the station's reactors going into standby modes.


      The space surrounding the station is filled with spatial distortions. Should
      the *Endeavour* strike an anomaly, the ship experiences a sudden power failure
      that removes 2 Power from the ship. The GameMaster may spend Threat to remove
      additional power, at a cost of 1 Threat for every 2 Power removed. The players
      may attempt a **Reason + Science** Task assisted by the ship's **Sensors +
      Science** with a Difficulty of 2 to detect the spatial anomalies. Once
      detected, the anomalies can be *Charted* using a **Reason + Conn** Task
      assisted by the ship's **Sensors + Conn** with a Difficulty of 3. A successful
      Task reduces the difficulty of any Task to avoid the anomalies by 2. Otherwise
      the difficulty of maneuvering through the anomalies is a Difficulty 3 **Daring
      + Conn** Task assisted by the ship's **Engines + Conn**.


      A closer study of the anomalies with a **Reason + Science** Task assisted by
      the ship's **Sensors + Science** with a Difficulty of 2 reveals important
      information about the periodic instability of the anomalies. A successful task
      reduces the complication range of Tasks related to reversing the effects of the
      experiment by 2.


      Should the players attempt to dissuade the Captain from proceeding towards the
      station, they will be reminded that Starfleet owes the Andorian Free State a
      great deal after their assistance with securing the Klingon border. Starfleet
      has issued specific instructions that the *Endeavour* is to render any and all
      assistance to the Andorian peoples, and without definitive evidence of imminent
      danger to the ship it is the Captain's duty to carry out those orders.
      Regardless of any arguments made, the Captain will not abandon his duty and
      will order the helm to close with the station so that DCC teams can be
      dispatched aboard shuttlepods.


      Once the Endeavour has made it to the station, or become crippled by the anomalies,
      the players feel a lurch in their stomachs yet again.
